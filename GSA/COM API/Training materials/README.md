This folder contains the training material for the course 'Working with GSA APIs'. 

The course is a day long, classroom-based training delivered by GSA developers. As such, the material in this folder is designed for a classroom oriented delivery rather than to serve as a standalone tutorial.

The day is divided into lectures interspersed by hands-on sessions where participants write code under the supervision of the trainer. The lectures are roughly based on the slides in file "Working with GSA APIs - Published.pdf". The slide notes in the slide might give some indication of proceedings, however, not everything that is discussed during the day is contained within the slides.

The hands-on sessions run as follows. After each topic in the API is introduced via a short lecture, a problem is set out for the participants to code up. Each hands-on is associated with a Visual studio project solution, including the project file and the code (.vb) file. The vb file already contains some boiler-plate code that is necessary to get started - for example, initializing the GSA COM object or opening and closing the model file. The goal of the hands-on is to add just the lines that use the API topic that has just been discussed. 

For the benefit of the audiences that are not in the classroom course, the solution to these hands-on sessions are including in the "cheatsheet.txt" file.

The final hands-on session is to size a truss for axial forces. This exercise brings together everything that has been covered during the day.
