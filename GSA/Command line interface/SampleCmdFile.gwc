// GSA accepts a GWC filename as a command line argument. 
// A GWC file is an ASCII file containing a number of commands. 
// The commands are processed by GSA as a batch operation 
// in the sequence in which they appear in the GWC file.
// A LOG file is produced in the GWC file folder.
//
// Notes:
// Text following "//" is ignored.
// Data file extensions GWB, GWA and CSV are valid.
// The SAVE command saves in the same format as last saved, or as read in format if not saved in this session.
// Where a view name is required the following are valid:
// the name of a saved view or view list
// ALL_PGV      - all preferred Graphic Views
// ALL_SGV      - all saved Graphic Views
// ALL_POV      - all preferred Output Views
// ALL_SOV      - all saved Output Views
// ALL_LST      - all views in all View Lists
// TAGGED_PGV   - selected preferred Graphic Views
// TAGGED_SGV   - selected saved Graphic Views
// TAGGED_POV   - selected preferred Output Views
// TAGGED_SOV   - selected saved Output Views
// TAGGED_LST   - all views in selected View Lists

//
// Sample GWC file: 
//
{
Open("c:\Views.gwb");					// open the GWB file     
Delete(RESULTS     );				        // delete results but not analysis cases
Delete(RESULTS_AND_CASES);				// delete results and analysis cases
Analyse();						// analyse all unanalysed cases, or if none, do static analysis of all load cases
Save();							// save file
SaveAs("c:\Views.csv");					// save as 'comma separated' format text file
SaveAs("c:\Views.gwa");					// save as 'tab separated' format text file
PrintView("TAGGED_SGV");				// print a view (it's a saved Graphic View)
SaveViewToFile("view list B", TXT);			// save Output Views to tab delimited TXT file
							// this is a view list so all Output Views in this view list will be saved
SaveViewToFile("view list A", PNG);			// save Graphic Views to PNG file
							// this is a view list so all Graphic Views in this view list will be saved
Close()
Exit()
}
