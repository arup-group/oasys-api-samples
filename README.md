# oasys-api-samples

Contains code samples for Oasys product APIs

The Oasys API samples here in the repository are supplied as examples for you to edit and use or take inspiration from when creating your own API scripts.

These samples currently cover GSA and AdSec, and include examples written in C++, .NET, Python, and VBA.

We welcome suggestions and further examples. If you have a script that you would like us to consider for inclusion, please email us at oasys@arup.com
